DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
       utilization metrics of your AWS resources, such as  EC2	instances  and
       Auto Scaling groups. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and
       generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost  and  improve
       the  performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides re-
       cent utilization metric data, as well as projected  utilization	metric
       data  for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which rec-
       ommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis
       of  your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your
       running resources, and still meet your  performance  and  capacity  re-
       quirements.  For  more information about Compute Optimizer, see the AWS
       Compute Optimizer User Guide .
