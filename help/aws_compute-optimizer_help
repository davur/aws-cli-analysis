DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
       utilization metrics of your AWS compute	resources,  such  as  EC2  in-
       stances, Auto Scaling groups, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS vol-
       umes. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates  op-
       timization  recommendations  to reduce the cost and improve the perfor-
       mance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also	provides  recent  uti-
       lization  metric data, as well as projected utilization metric data for
       the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation
       provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your us-
       age patterns can help you decide when to move or  resize  your  running
       resources,  and	still meet your performance and capacity requirements.
       For more information about Compute Optimizer,  including  the  required
       permissions  to	use  the  service,  see the AWS Compute Optimizer User
       Guide .
