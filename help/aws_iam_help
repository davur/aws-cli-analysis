DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can
       use to manage users and user permissions under your AWS	account.  This
       guide  provides	descriptions of IAM actions that you can call program-
       matically. For general information about IAM, see AWS Identity and  Ac-
       cess Management (IAM) . For the user guide for IAM, see Using IAM .

       NOTE:
	  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
	  ious programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, An-
	  droid,  etc.).  The SDKs provide a convenient way to create program-
	  matic access to IAM and AWS. For example,  the  SDKs	take  care  of
	  tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), manag-
	  ing errors, and retrying  requests  automatically.  For  information
	  about  the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
	  the Tools for Amazon Web Services page.

       We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic  API  calls
       to  IAM.  However,  you	can  also use the IAM Query API to make direct
       calls to the IAM web service. To learn more about the  IAM  Query  API,
       see  Making Query Requests in the Using IAM guide. IAM supports GET and
       POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to
       use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are
       subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that
       require larger sizes, use a POST request.
	  Signing Requests

       Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key.
       We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account  access  key
       ID  and	secret	access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the
       access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use  the
       AWS  Security  Token Service to generate temporary security credentials
       and use those to sign requests.

       To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version  4  .  If
       you  have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do
       not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some	opera-
       tions now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations
       that require version 4 indicate this requirement.

	 about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.

	 using the IAM service to help secure your AWS resources.

       o Signing AWS API Requests . This set of topics walk  you  through  the
	 process of signing a request using an access key ID and secret access
	 key.
