DESCRIPTION
	  Overview

       This  is  an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains docu-
       mentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can
       use  to	manage	Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is
       asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require  techniques,
       such  as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a
       command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions
       indicate  whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance
       reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For  a  summary  of  the
       Amazon  Redshift  cluster management interfaces, go to Using the Amazon
       Redshift Management Interfaces .

       Amazon Redshift manages all the work  of  setting  up,  operating,  and
       scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing
       up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to  the  Amazon  Red-
       shift  engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights
       for your business and customers.

       If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that  you
       begin by reading the The Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide

       If you are a database developer, the Amazon Redshift Database Developer
       Guide explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the  databases
       that make up your data warehouse.
