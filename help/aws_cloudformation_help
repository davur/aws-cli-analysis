DESCRIPTION
       AWS  CloudFormation  allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
       deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use AWS	CloudFormation
       to  leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon
       Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service,  Elastic  Load
       Balancing,  and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable,
       cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the	under-
       lying AWS infrastructure.

       With  AWS  CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and depen-
       dencies in a template file. The template defines a  collection  of  re-
       sources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and
       deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all  de-
       pendencies between the resources for you.

       For  more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the AWS CloudForma-
       tion Product Page .

       Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need  ad-
       ditional  technical  information  about a specific AWS product, you can
       find the product's technical documentation at docs.aws.amazon.com .
