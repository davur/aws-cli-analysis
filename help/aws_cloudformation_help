DESCRIPTION
       AWS  CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
       deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS  CloudFormation  helps  you
       leverage  AWS  products	such  as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and
       Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost  effective
       applications without worrying about creating and configuring the under-
       lying AWS infrastructure.

       With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources  and	depen-
       dencies	in  a  template file. The template defines a collection of re-
       sources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and
       deletes	all member resources of the stack together and manages all de-
       pendencies between the resources for you.

       ditional technical information about a specific AWS  product,  you  can
