DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  CloudWatch  Application	Insights  for .NET and SQL Server is a
       service that helps you detect common problems with your	.NET  and  SQL
       Server-based applications. It enables you to pinpoint the source of is-
       sues in your applications (built with technologies  such  as  Microsoft
       IIS,  .NET,  and  Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into
       detected problems.

       After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights for
       .NET  and  SQL  Server  identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and
       logs. It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for
       unusual	behavior to surface actionable problems with your application.
       For example, if your application is slow and unresponsive  and  leading
       to HTTP 500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application
       Insights informs you that a  memory  pressure  problem  with  your  SQL
       Server  database is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful met-
       rics and log errors.
