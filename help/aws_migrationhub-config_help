NAME
       migrationhub-config -

DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS  Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for
       working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs  to
       determine  a  home  region, as well as to create and work with controls
       that describe the home region.

       You can use these APIs within your home region only. If you call  these
       APIs from outside your home region, your calls are rejected, except for
       the ability to register your agents and connectors.

       You must call GetHomeRegion at least once before you call any other AWS
       Application Discovery Service and AWS Migration Hub APIs, to obtain the
       account's Migration Hub home region.

       The StartDataCollection API call in AWS Application  Discovery  Service
       allows  your  agents and connectors to begin collecting data that flows
       directly into the home region, and it will prevent  you	from  enabling
       data collection information to be sent outside the home region.

       For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migra-
       tion Hub Home Region API reference.

       NOTE:
	  The Migration Hub Home Region APIs do not support AWS Organizations.
