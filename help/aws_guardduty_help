DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that ana-
       lyzes and processes the following data  sources:  VPC  Flow  Logs,  AWS
       CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds,
       such as lists of malicious IPs and domains,  and  machine  learning  to
       identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity
       within your AWS environment. This can include issues  like  escalations
       of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with mali-
       cious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect  compro-
       mised EC2 instances serving malware or mining bitcoin. It also monitors
       AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such  as  unautho-
       rized  infrastructure  deployments, like instances deployed in a region
       that has never been used, or unusual API calls, like a password	policy
       change to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you of the status
       of your AWS environment by producing security  findings	that  you  can
       view  in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For
       more information, see Amazon GuardDuty User Guide .
