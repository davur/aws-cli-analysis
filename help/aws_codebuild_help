NAME
       codebuild -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS Code-
       Build compiles your source code, runs unit tests,  and  produces  arti-
       facts  that  are  ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to
       provision, manage, and  scale  your  own  build	servers.  It  provides
       prepackaged  build  environments  for the most popular programming lan-
       guages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can
       also  fully  customize  build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your
       own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak  build
       requests, and you pay only for the build time you consume. For more in-
       formation about AWS CodeBuild, see the AWS CodeBuild User Guide .

       AWS CodeBuild supports these operations:

       o batch-delete-builds : Deletes one or more builds.

       o batch-get-projects  :	Gets  information  about  one  or  more  build
	 projects. A build project defines how AWS CodeBuild will run a build.
	 This includes information such as where to get  the  source  code  to
	 build,  the  build environment to use, the build commands to run, and
	 where to store the build output. A  build  environment  represents  a
	 combination  of  operating  system, programming language runtime, and
	 tools that AWS CodeBuild will use to run a build. Also, you  can  add
	 tags to build projects to help manage your resources and costs.

       o create-project : Creates a build project.

       o create-webhook : For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has
	 its source code stored in a GitHub repository, enables AWS  CodeBuild
	 to  begin  automatically rebuilding the source code every time a code
	 change is pushed to the repository.

       o update-webhook : Changes the settings of an existing webhook.

       o delete-project : Deletes a build project.

       o delete-webhook : For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has
	 its  source  code  stored in a GitHub repository, stops AWS CodeBuild
	 from automatically rebuilding the  source  code  every  time  a  code
	 change is pushed to the repository.

       o list-projects	:  Gets a list of build project names, with each build
	 project name representing a single build project.

       o update-project : Changes the settings of an existing build project.

       o batch-get-builds : Gets information about one or more builds.

       o list-builds : Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID represent-
	 ing a single build.

       o list-builds-for-project  : Gets a list of build IDs for the specified
	 build project, with each build ID representing a single build.

       o start-build : Starts running a build.

       o stop-build : Attempts to stop running a build.

       o list-curated-environment-images : Gets information about  Docker  im-
	 ages that are managed by AWS CodeBuild.
