NAME
       codebuild -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS Code-
       Build compiles your source code, runs unit tests,  and  produces  arti-
       facts  that  are  ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to
       provision, manage, and  scale  your  own  build	servers.  It  provides
       prepackaged  build  environments  for the most popular programming lan-
       guages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can
       also  fully  customize  build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your
       own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak  build
       requests.  You pay only for the build time you consume. For more infor-
       mation about AWS CodeBuild, see the * AWS CodeBuild User Guide .*

       AWS CodeBuild supports these operations:

       o BatchDeleteBuilds : Deletes one or more builds.

       o BatchGetBuilds : Gets information about one or more builds.

       o BatchGetProjects : Gets information about one or more build projects.
	 A build project defines how AWS CodeBuild runs a build. This includes
	 information such as where to get the source code to build, the  build
	 environment to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the
	 build output. A build environment is a  representation  of  operating
	 system,  programming  language  runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild
	 uses to run a build. You can add tags to build projects to help  man-
	 age your resources and costs.

       o BatchGetReports : Returns an array of reports.

	 by its resource ARN.

       o DeleteSourceCredentials : Deletes a set of GitHub, GitHub Enterprise,
	 or Bitbucket source credentials.

       o DeleteWebhook	: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has
	 its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, stops AWS
	 CodeBuild from rebuilding the source code every time a code change is
	 pushed to the repository.

       o DescribeTestCases : Returns a list of details about test cases for  a
	 report.

       o GetResourcePolicy  : Gets a resource policy that is identified by its

	 GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket repository.

       o InvalidateProjectCache : Resets the cache for a project.

       o ListBuilds : Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID  represent-
	 ing a single build.

       o ListBuildsForProject  :  Gets	a  list of build IDs for the specified

       o ListSharedReportGroups : Gets a list of ARNs associated  with	report
	 groups shared with the current AWS account or user

       o ListSourceCredentials	:  Returns a list of SourceCredentialsInfo ob-
	 jects. Each SourceCredentialsInfo object includes the	authentication
	 type,	token  ARN, and type of source provider for one set of creden-
	 tials.

       o PutResourcePolicy : Stores a resource policy for the ARN of a Project
	 or ReportGroup object.

       o StartBuild : Starts running a build.

       o StopBuild : Attempts to stop running a build.

       o UpdateProject : Changes the settings of an existing build project.
