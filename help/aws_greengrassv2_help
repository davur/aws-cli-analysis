DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT  Greengrass  brings local compute, messaging, data management,
       sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This  enables  de-
       vices  to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information,
       react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with  each
       other  on  local  networks. Local devices can also communicate securely
       with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT	Green-
       grass  developers can use AWS Lambda functions and components to create
       and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.

       AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version  of  the  AWS
       IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API
       reference to learn how to use the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 API  operations
       to manage components, manage deployments, and core devices.

       For  more  information,	see What is AWS IoT Greengrass? in the AWS IoT
       Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .
