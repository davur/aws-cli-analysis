DESCRIPTION
       A  load	balancer  distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as
       your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase  the  availability  of
       your  application.  The	load  balancer also monitors the health of its
       registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only  to  healthy
       targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by
       specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a  protocol
       and  port number for connections from clients to the load balancer. You
       configure a target group with a protocol and port  number  for  connec-
       tions from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check set-
       tings to be used when checking the health status of the targets.

       Elastic Load Balancing supports two types of  load  balancers:  Classic
       load  balancers	and  Application  load balancers (new). A Classic load
       balancer makes routing and  load  balancing  decisions  either  at  the
       transport  layer  (TCP/SSL)  or the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), and
       supports either EC2-Classic or a  VPC.  An  Application	load  balancer
       makes  routing  and  load  balancing decisions at the application layer
       (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based routing, and can  route  requests  to
       one  or	more  ports on each EC2 instance or container instance in your
       virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see the Elastic Load
       Balancing User Guide .

       This  reference	covers	the 2015-12-01 API, which supports Application
       load balancers. The 2012-06-01 API supports Classic load balancers.

       To get started with an Application load balancer, complete the  follow-
       ing tasks:

       o Create a load balancer using  create-load-balancer .

       o Create a target group using  create-target-group .

       o Register targets for the target group using  register-targets .

       o Create  one  or  more	listeners  for	your load balancer using  cre-
	 ate-listener .

       o (Optional) Create one or more rules for content routing based on  URL
	 using	create-rule .

       To  delete an Application load balancer and its related resources, com-
       plete the following tasks:

       o Delete the load balancer using  delete-load-balancer .

       o Delete the target group using	delete-target-group .

       All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means  that
       they  complete  at  most  one time. If you repeat an operation, it suc-
       ceeds.
