DESCRIPTION
       Service Quotas is a web service that you can use to manage many of your
       AWS service quotas. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum
       values  for a resource, item, or operation. This guide provide descrip-
       tions of the Service Quotas actions that you can call from an API.  For
       the Service Quotas user guide, which explains how to use Service Quotas
       from the console, see What is Service Quotas .

       NOTE:
	  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for pro-
	  gramming  languages  and  platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
	  etc...,). The SDKs provide a convenient way to  create  programmatic
	  access  to  Service  Quotas  and  AWS. For information about the AWS
	  SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the Tools  for
	  Amazon Web Services page.
