DESCRIPTION
       This  guide  describes  the API operations for the resource groups tag-
       ging.

       A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists  of
       a  key  and a value, both of which you define. For example, if you have
       two Amazon EC2 instances, you might assign both a tag key  of  "Stack."
       But  the  value	of "Stack" might be "Testing" for one and "Production"
       for the other.

       Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables  you  to  sim-
       plify resource management, access management and cost allocation.

       You  can use the resource groups tagging API operations to complete the
       following tasks:

       o Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified Region for
	 the AWS account.

       o Use  tag-based  filters to search for resources located in the speci-
	 fied Region for the AWS account.

       o List all existing tag keys in the specified Region for  the  AWS  ac-
	 count.

       o List  all  existing values for the specified key in the specified Re-
	 gion for the AWS account.

       To use resource groups tagging API operations, you must add the follow-
       ing permissions to your IAM policy:

       o tag:GetResources

       o tag:TagResources

       o tag:UntagResources

       o tag:GetTagKeys

       o tag:GetTagValues

       You'll also need permissions to access the resources of individual ser-
       vices so that you can tag and untag those resources.

       For more information on IAM policies, see Managing IAM Policies in  the
       IAM User Guide .

       You  can  use  the Resource Groups Tagging API to tag resources for the
