DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IAM Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks
       by enabling you to identify any policies that grant access to an exter-
       nal  principal.	It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze
       resource-based policies in your AWS environment. An external  principal
       can  be another AWS account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a feder-
       ated user, an AWS service, or an anonymous user. You can also  use  Ac-
       cess  Analyzer  to preview and validate public and cross-account access
       to your resources before deploying permissions changes. This guide  de-
       scribes	the  AWS IAM Access Analyzer operations that you can call pro-
       grammatically. For general information about Access Analyzer,  see  AWS
       IAM Access Analyzer in the IAM User Guide .

       To start using Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.
