NAME
       route53resolver -

DESCRIPTION
       Here's  how  you set up to query an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone
       from your network:

       o Connect your network to a VPC using AWS Direct Connect or a VPN.

       o Run the following AWS CLI command  to	create	a  Resolver  endpoint:
	 create-resolver-endpoint  --name  [endpoint_name] --direction INBOUND
	 --creator-request-id  [unique_string]	 --security-group-ids	[secu-
	 rity_group_with_inbound_rules]   --ip-addresses  SubnetId=[subnet_id]
	 SubnetId=[subnet_id_in_different_AZ]	Note the resolver endpoint  ID
	 that appears in the response. You'll use it in step 3.

       o Get  the  IP addresses for the Resolver endpoints:  get-resolver-end-
	 point --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]

       o In your network configuration, define the IP addresses that  you  got
	 in  step  3  as DNS servers. You can now query instance names in your
	 VPCs and the names of records in your private hosted zone.

       You can also perform the following operations using the AWS CLI:

       o list-resolver-endpoints : List all endpoints. The syntax includes op-
	 tions for pagination and filtering.

       o update-resolver-endpoints : Add IP addresses to an endpoint or remove
	 IP addresses from an endpoint.

       To delete an endpoint, use the following AWS CLI command:
	  delete-resolver-endpoint    --resolver-endpoint-id	[resolver_end-
	  point_id]
