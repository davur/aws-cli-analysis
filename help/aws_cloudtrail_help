DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of ac-
       tions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

       CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS ac-
       count  and  delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded in-
       formation includes the identity of the user, the start time of the  AWS
       API  call,  the	source IP address, the request parameters, and the re-
       sponse elements returned by the service.

       See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the	data  that  is
       included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.
