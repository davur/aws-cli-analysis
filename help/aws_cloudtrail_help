DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of ac-
       tions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

       CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS ac-
       count  and  delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded in-
       formation includes the identity of the user, the start time of the  AWS
       API  call,  the	source IP address, the request parameters, and the re-
       sponse elements returned by the service.

       NOTE:
	  As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,
	  which  consist  of libraries and sample code for various programming
	  languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.).  The
	  SDKs	provide  a  convenient	way  to  create programmatic access to
	  AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of  cryptographically
	  signing  requests,  managing errors, and retrying requests automati-
	  cally. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download
	  and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page .

       See  the  CloudTrail  User Guide for information about the data that is
       included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.
