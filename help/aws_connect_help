DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Connect	is a cloud-based contact center solution that makes it
       easy to set up and manage a customer contact center and	provide  reli-
       able customer engagement at any scale.

       Amazon Connect provides rich metrics and real-time reporting that allow
       you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve  customer	issues
       more efficiently by putting customers in touch with the right agents.
