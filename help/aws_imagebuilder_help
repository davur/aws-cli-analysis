NAME
       imagebuilder -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic Compute Cloud Image Builder provides a one-stop-shop to
       automate the image management processes.  You  configure  an  automated
       pipeline that creates images for use on AWS. As software updates become
       available, Image Builder automatically produces a new image based on  a
       customizable  schedule and distributes it to stipulated AWS Regions af-
       ter running tests on it. With the Image Builder, organizations can cap-
       ture  their internal or industry-specific compliance policies as a vet-
       ted template that can be  consistently  applied	to  every  new	image.
       Built-in  integration  with AWS Organizations provides customers with a
       centralized way to  enforce  image  distribution  and  access  policies
       across  their AWS accounts and Regions. Image Builder supports multiple
       image format AMIs on AWS.
