DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a man-
       aged service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS  with-
       out  needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane.
       Kubernetes is an open-source  system  for  automating  the  deployment,
       scaling, and management of containerized applications.

       Amazon  EKS  runs three Kubernetes control plane instances across three
       Availability Zones to ensure high availability.	Amazon	EKS  automati-
       cally  detects  and  replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it
       provides automated version upgrades and patching for them.

       Amazon EKS is also integrated with many AWS services to provide	scala-
       bility and security for your applications, including the following:

       o Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution

       o IAM for authentication

       o Amazon VPC for isolation

       Amazon EKS runs up to date versions of the open-source Kubernetes soft-
       ware, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the  Ku-
       bernetes  community.  Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully com-
       patible with applications running on any standard  Kubernetes  environ-
       ment,  whether  running	in  on-premises data centers or public clouds.
       This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes applica-
       tion to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.
