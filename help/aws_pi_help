DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Performance  Insights enables you to monitor and explore different
       dimensions of database load based on data captured from a  running  RDS
       instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance In-
       sights data types, parameters and errors. For  more  information  about
       Performance  Insights capabilities see Using Amazon RDS Performance In-
       sights in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       The AWS Performance Insights API provides visibility into  the  perfor-
       mance  of  your	RDS instance, when Performance Insights is enabled for
       supported engine types. While Amazon CloudWatch provides the authorita-
       tive  source for AWS service vended monitoring metrics, AWS Performance
       Insights offers a domain-specific view of database load measured as Av-
       erage  Active Sessions and provided to API consumers as a 2-dimensional
       time-series dataset. The time dimension of the data  provides  DB  load
       data for each time point in the queried time range, and each time point
       decomposes overall load in relation to the requested  dimensions,  such
       as SQL, Wait-event, User or Host, measured at that time point.
