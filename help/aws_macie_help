DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Macie  Classic is a security service that uses machine learning
       to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS.
       Macie Classic recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable
       information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with dash-
       boards  and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being ac-
       cessed or moved. For more information, see  the	Amazon	Macie  Classic
       User Guide .

       A  new  Amazon  Macie is now available with significant design improve-
       ments and additional features, at a lower price and  in	most  AWS  Re-
       gions.  We  encourage  you to explore and use the new and improved fea-
       tures, and benefit from the reduced cost. To learn about  features  and
       pricing for the new Amazon Macie, see Amazon Macie .
