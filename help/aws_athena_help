DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Athena  is an interactive query service that lets you use stan-
       dard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at
       your  data  in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in sec-
       onds. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up  or
       manage.	You  pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales automati-
       callyexecuting queries in parallelso results are fast, even with  large
       datasets  and complex queries. For more information, see What is Amazon
       Athena in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

       If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use  version  1.1.0  of
       the driver or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers
       do not support the API.	For  more  information	and  to  download  the
       driver, see Accessing Amazon Athena with JDBC .

       For code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see Examples and Code Sam-
       ples in the Amazon Athena User Guide .
