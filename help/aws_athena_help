DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Athena  is an interactive query service that lets you use stan-
       dard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at
       your  data  in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in sec-
       onds. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up  or
       manage.	You  pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales automati-
       callyexecuting queries in parallelso results are fast, even with  large
       datasets  and complex queries. For more information, see What is Amazon
       Athena in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

       For code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see Examples and Code Sam-
       ples in the Amazon Athena User Guide .
