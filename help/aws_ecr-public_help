DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic	Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container
       image registry service. Amazon ECR provides  both  public  and  private
       registries  to  host  your  container  images. You can use the familiar
       Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull,  and  manage  im-
       ages. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for
       your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR  sup-
       ports public repositories with this API. For information about the Ama-
       zon ECR API for private repositories, see Amazon Elastic Container Reg-
       istry API Reference .
