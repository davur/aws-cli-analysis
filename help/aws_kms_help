DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Key  Management  Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management
       web service. This guide describes the KMS actions  that	you  can  call
       programmatically.  For  general	information about KMS, see the AWS Key
       Management Service Developer Guide

       NOTE:
	  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
	  ious programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, An-
	  droid, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to  create  program-
	  matic  access  to  KMS  and  AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of
	  tasks such as signing requests (see  below),	managing  errors,  and
	  retrying  requests automatically. For more information about the AWS
	  SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Ama-
	  zon Web Services .

       We  recommend  that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls
       to KMS.

       Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0.  We  recommend
       TLS  1.2.  Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward
       Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic  Curve
       Ephemeral  Diffie-Hellman  (ECDHE).  Most modern systems such as Java 7
       and later support these modes.

       Signing Requests

       Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a	secret	access
       key.  We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access
       key ID and secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the  ac-
       cess  key  ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the
       AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary  security  credentials
       that you can use to sign requests.

       All KMS operations require Signature Version 4 .

       Recording API Requests

       KMS  supports  AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls and
       related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an  Amazon  S3
       bucket  that  you specify. By using the information collected by Cloud-
       Trail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who  made  the
       request,  when  it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail,
       including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS Cloud-
       Trail User Guide

       than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using  the
       console.
