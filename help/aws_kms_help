DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Key  Management  Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management
       web service. This guide describes the KMS actions  that	you  can  call
       programmatically.  For  general information about KMS, see (need an ad-
       dress here). For the KMS developer guide, see (need address here).

       NOTE:
	  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
	  ious programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, An-
	  droid, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to  create  program-
	  matic  access  to  KMS  and  AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of
	  tasks such as signing requests (see  below),	managing  errors,  and
	  retrying  requests automatically. For more information about the AWS
	  SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Ama-
	  zon Web Services .

       We  recommend  that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls
       to KMS. However, you can also use the KMS Query API to make to make di-
       rect calls to the KMS web service.

       Signing Requests

       Requests  must  be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access
       key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account	access
       key  ID and secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the ac-
       cess key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can  use  the
       AWS  Security  Token Service to generate temporary security credentials
       that you can use to sign requests.

       All KMS operations require Signature Version 4 .

       Recording API Requests

       KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API  calls  and
       related	events	for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3
       bucket that you specify. By using the information collected  by	Cloud-
       Trail,  you  can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the
       request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more  about  CloudTrail,
       including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS Cloud-
       Trail User Guide
