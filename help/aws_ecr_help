DESCRIPTION
       Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed AWS Docker reg-
       istry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI to push, pull,
       and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable
       registry. Amazon ECR supports  private  Docker  repositories  with  re-
       source-based permissions using AWS IAM so that specific users or Amazon
       EC2 instances can access repositories and images.  Developers  can  use
       the Docker CLI to author and manage images.
