DESCRIPTION
       Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed Docker reg-
       istry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI to push, pull,
       and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable
       registry. Amazon ECR supports  private  Docker  repositories  with  re-
       source-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2
       instances can access repositories and images. Developers  can  use  the
       Docker CLI to author and manage images.
