DESCRIPTION
       This  section  provides	documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler
       API operations.
	  `` pAmazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data  from
	  your	live  applications, and provides recommendations that can help
	  you fine-tune your application performance. Using  machine  learning
	  algorithms,  CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most expensive
	  lines of code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and remove
	  CPU bottlenecks. /p pAmazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different vi-
	  sualizations of profiling data to help you  identify	what  code  is
	  running  on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways
	  to reduce CPU utilization. /p note pAmazon  CodeGuru	Profiler  cur-
	  rently  supports  applications  written  in all Java virtual machine
	  (JVM) languages. While CodeGuru Profiler  supports  both  visualiza-
	  tions  and  recommendations for applications written in Java, it can
	  also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for ap-
	  plications  written in other JVM languages./p /note pFor more infor-
