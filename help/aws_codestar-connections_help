DESCRIPTION
       This  AWS  CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and
       usage examples of the operations and data types for  the  AWS  CodeStar
       Connections  API.  You can use the Connections API to work with connec-
       tions and installations.
	  Connections are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources
	  to  external	code  repositories. Each connection is a resource that
	  can be given to services  such  as  CodePipeline  to	connect  to  a
	  third-party  repository  such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add
	  the connection in CodePipeline so that  it  triggers	your  pipeline
	  when a code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each
	  connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to
	  reference the connection.

       When  you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party con-
       nection handshake. Installations are the apps that are used to  conduct
       this  handshake.  For  example,	the  installation  for	the  Bitbucket
       provider type is the Bitbucket Cloud app. When you create a connection,
       you can choose an existing installation or create one.

       You can work with connections by calling:

       o CreateConnection , which creates a uniquely named connection that can
	 be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.

       o DeleteConnection , which deletes the specified connection.

       o GetConnection , which returns information about the  connection,  in-
	 cluding the connection status.

       o ListConnections  ,  which  lists the connections associated with your
	 account.

       For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the  AWS
       CodePipeline User Guide .
