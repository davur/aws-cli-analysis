DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Cognito is a web service that delivers scoped temporary creden-
       tials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments.  Amazon  Cog-
       nito  uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consis-
       tent identity over the lifetime of an application.

       Using Amazon Cognito, you can enable authentication with  one  or  more
       third-party  identity  providers  (Facebook, Google, or Login with Ama-
       zon), and you can also choose to support  unauthenticated  access  from
       your  app.  Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts
       as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS)
       to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.

       To  provide end-user credentials, first make an unsigned call to  GetId
       . If the end user is authenticated with one of the  supported  identity
       providers,  set	the Logins map with the identity provider token. GetId
       returns a unique identifier for the user.

       Next, make an unsigned call to  GetCredentialsForIdentity .  This  call
       expects	the  same Logins map as the GetId call, as well as the Identi-
       tyID originally returned by GetId . Assuming  your  identity  pool  has
       been  configured  via  the   SetIdentityPoolRoles operation, GetCreden-
       tialsForIdentity will return AWS credentials for your use. If your pool
       has  not  been configured with SetIdentityPoolRoles , or if you want to
       follow legacy flow, make an unsigned call to   GetOpenIdToken  ,  which
       returns the OpenID token necessary to call STS and retrieve AWS creden-
       tials. This call expects the same Logins map as the GetId call, as well
       as  the IdentityID originally returned by GetId . The token returned by
       GetOpenIdToken	 can	be    passed	to    the    STS     operation
       AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity to retrieve AWS credentials.

       If you want to use Amazon Cognito in an Android, iOS, or Unity applica-
       tion, you will probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile  SDK.
       To learn more, see the AWS Mobile SDK Developer Guide .
