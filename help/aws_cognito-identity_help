DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Cognito	is  a  web  service  that  facilitates the delivery of
       scoped, temporary credentials to mobile devices or other untrusted  en-
       vironments.  Amazon  Cognito  uniquely  identifies a device or user and
       supplies the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of
       an application.

       Amazon  Cognito	lets  users  authenticate  with  third-party  identity
       providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon). As a developer, you
       decide  which  identity providers to trust. You can also choose to sup-
       port unauthenticated access from your application. Your users are  pro-
       vided  with  Cognito tokens that uniquely identify their device and any
       information provided about third-party logins.
