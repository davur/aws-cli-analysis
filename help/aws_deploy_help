DESCRIPTION
	  Overview

       This  is the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference. This guide provides descrip-
       tions of the AWS CodeDeploy APIs. For additional information,  see  the
       AWS CodeDeploy User Guide .
	  Using the APIs

       You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to work with the following items:

       o Applications  are  unique identifiers that AWS CodeDeploy uses to en-
	 sure that the correct combinations of revisions, deployment  configu-
	 rations,  and	deployment  groups are being referenced during deploy-
	 ments. You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to	create,  delete,  get,
	 list, and update applications.

       o Deployment configurations are sets of deployment rules and deployment
	 success and failure conditions that AWS CodeDeploy  uses  during  de-
	 ployments.  You  can  use  the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete,
	 get, and list deployment configurations.

       o Deployment groups are groups of instances to which application  revi-
	 sions can be deployed. You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create,
	 delete, get, list, and update deployment groups.

       o Instances represent Amazon EC2 instances to which  application  revi-
	 sions are deployed. Instances are identified by their Amazon EC2 tags
	 or Auto Scaling group names. Instances belong to  deployment  groups.
	 You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get and list instances.

       o Deployments  represent  the  process  of  deploying  revisions to in-
	 stances. You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to  create,  get,  list,
	 and stop deployments.

       o Application  revisions are archive files that are stored in Amazon S3
	 buckets or GitHub repositories. These revisions contain  source  con-
	 tent  (such  as source code, web pages, executable files, any deploy-
	 ment scripts, and similar) along with	an  Application  Specification
	 file  (AppSpec  file). (The AppSpec file is unique to AWS CodeDeploy;
	 it defines a series of deployment actions that you want  AWS  CodeDe-
	 ploy  to  execute.) An application revision is uniquely identified by
	 its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both (for applica-
	 tion revisions that are stored in Amazon S3 buckets) or by its repos-
	 itory name and commit ID (for applications revisions that are	stored
	 in  GitHub  repositories). Application revisions are deployed through
	 deployment groups. You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get,  list,
	 and register application revisions.
