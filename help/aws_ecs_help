DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic	Container  Service  (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable,
       fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and
       manage  Docker  containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a
       serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon  ECS  by  launching
       your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control,
       you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon  Elastic	Compute  Cloud
       (Amazon	EC2)  instances  that you manage by using the EC2 launch type.
       For more information about launch types, see Amazon ECS Launch Types .

       Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based  applications  with
       simple  API  calls,  allows you to get the state of your cluster from a
       centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar  Amazon  EC2
       features.

       You  can  use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across
       your cluster based on your  resource  needs,  isolation	policies,  and
       availability  requirements.  Amazon  ECS eliminates the need for you to
       operate your own cluster management and configuration  management  sys-
       tems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
