DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  EC2  Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
       container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and  man-
       age  Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS
       lets you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API
       calls,  allows  you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized
       service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like
       security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.

       You  can  use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across
       your cluster based on your  resource  needs,  isolation	policies,  and
       availability  requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the
       need for you to operate your own cluster management  and  configuration
       management  systems  or worry about scaling your management infrastruc-
       ture.
