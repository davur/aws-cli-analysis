NAME
       appmesh -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  App  Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it
       easy to monitor and control microservices. App  Mesh  standardizes  how
       your  microservices  communicate,  giving you end-to-end visibility and
       helping to ensure high availability for your applications.

       App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network  traffic  controls
       for every microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with AWS
       Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on AWS, and Amazon EC2.

       NOTE:
	  App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discov-
	  ery  naming for their components. For more information about service
	  discovery on Amazon ECS, see Service Discovery in the Amazon Elastic
	  Container  Service Developer Guide . Kubernetes kube-dns and coredns
	  are supported. For more information, see DNS for Services  and  Pods
	  in the Kubernetes documentation.
