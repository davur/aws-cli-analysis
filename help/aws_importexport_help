DESCRIPTION
	  AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring large amounts of data be-
	  tween the AWS cloud and portable storage devices that  you  mail  to
	  us.  AWS  Import/Export transfers data directly onto and off of your
	  storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network  and  by-
	  passing  the Internet. For large data sets, AWS Import/Export is of-
	  ten faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective  than  up-
	  grading your connectivity.
