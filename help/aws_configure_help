NAME
       configure -

DESCRIPTION
       Configure  AWS  CLI configuration data.	If this command is run with no
       arguments, you will be prompted for configuration values such  as  your
       AWS  Access  Key Id and you AWS Secret Access Key.  You can configure a
       specific profile using the --profile argument.	If  your  config  file
       does  not exist (the default location is ~/.aws/config), it will be au-
       tomatically created for you.  To keep an existing value, hit enter when
       prompted  for  the  value.   When you are prompted for information, the
       current value will be displayed in [brackets].  If the config item  has
       no  value,  it be displayed as [None].  Note that the configure command
       only work with values from the config file.  It does not use  any  con-
       figuration values from environment variables or the IAM role.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The following configuration variables are supported in the config file:

       o aws_access_key_id - The AWS access key part of your credentials

       o aws_secret_access_key	-  The AWS secret access key part of your cre-
	 dentials

       o aws_security_token - The security  token  part  of  your  credentials
	 (session tokens only)

       o metadata_service_timeout  -  The  number of seconds to wait until the
	 metadata service request times out.  This is used if you are using an
	 IAM role to provide your credentials.

       o metadata_service_num_attempts	- The number of attempts to try to re-
	 trieve credentials.  If you know for certain you will be using an IAM
	 role  on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can set this value to ensure any
	 intermittent failures are retried.  By default this value is 1.
