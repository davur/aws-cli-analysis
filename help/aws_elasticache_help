NAME
       elasticache -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, op-
       erate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.

       With ElastiCache, customers gain all of the benefits of a  high-perfor-
       mance,  in-memory  cache  with far less of the administrative burden of
       launching and managing a distributed cache. The	service  makes	setup,
       scaling,  and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-man-
       aged cache deployment.

       In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers  get
       enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with
       their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.
