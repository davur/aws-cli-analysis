DESCRIPTION
	  Introduction

       The  Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, us-
       ing a standard HTTP API and an AWS SNS event stream for responses. JSON
       is used for both requests and responses, including errors.

       The  API  is  an  AWS  regional	service,  currently  in these regions:
       us-west-2, us-east-1, and eu-west-1.

	  o All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. *

       For a summary of notable documentation changes  in  each  release,  see
       Document History .
	  Service Endpoints

       The following are the Amazon IVS service endpoints (all HTTPS):

       Region name: US West (Oregon)

       o Region: us-west-2

       o Endpoint: ivs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Region name: US East (Virginia)

       o Region: us-east-1

       o Endpoint: ivs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

       Region name: EU West (Dublin)

       o Region: eu-west-1

       o Endpoint: ivs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

	  Resources

       The  following resources contain information about your IVS live stream
       (see Getting Started with Amazon IVS ):

       o Channel  Stores configuration data related to your live  stream.  You
	 first	create a channel and then use the channels stream key to start
	 your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information.

       o Stream key  An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when	you  create  a
	 channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey
	 endpoints for more information. * Treat the stream key like a secret,
	 since it allows anyone to stream to the channel. *

       o Playback  key	pair   Video  playback	may  be restricted using play-
	 back-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption.  A  play-
	 back  key  pair  is  the public-private pair of keys used to sign and
	 validate the playback-authorization token.  See  the  PlaybackKeyPair
	 endpoints for more information.
	  Tagging

       A  tag  is  a  metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
       comprises a key and a value , both set by you. For example,  you  might
       set  a  tag  as	topic:nature to label a particular video category. See
       Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that
       apply to tags.

       Tags  can  help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For exam-
       ple, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate  that
       they  are  related.  You can also use tags to manage access (see Access
       Tags ).

       The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints:  TagResource ,  Un-
       tagResource  ,  and  ListTagsForResource . The following resources sup-
       port tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, and Playback Key Pairs.
	  Channel Endpoints

       o CreateChannel	Creates a new channel and an associated stream key  to
	 start streaming.

       o GetChannel   Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel
	 ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

       o BatchGetChannel  Performs  GetChannel	on  multiple  ARNs  simultane-
	 ously.

       o ListChannels  Gets summary information about all channels in your ac-
	 count, in the AWS region where the API  request  is  processed.  This
	 list can be filtered to match a specified string.

       o UpdateChannel	 Updates  a channel's configuration. This does not af-
	 fect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the
	 stream for the changes to take effect.

       o DeleteChannel	Deletes the specified channel.
	  StreamKey Endpoints

       o CreateStreamKey  Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for
	 the specified channel ARN.

       o GetStreamKey  Gets stream key information for the specified ARN.

       o BatchGetStreamKey  Performs  GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultane-
	 ously.

       o ListStreamKeys   Gets	summary  information about stream keys for the
	 specified channel.

       o DeleteStreamKey  Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so  it
	 can no longer be used to stream.
	  Stream Endpoints

       o GetStream  Gets information about the active (live) stream on a spec-
	 ified channel.

       o ListStreams  Gets summary information about live streams in your  ac-
	 count, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.

       o StopStream   Disconnects  the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified
	 channel. Can be used in conjunction with  DeleteStreamKey to  prevent
	 further streaming to a channel.

       o PutMetadata   Inserts metadata into an RTMPS stream for the specified
	 channel. A maximum of 5 requests per second per channel  is  allowed,
	 each with a maximum 1KB payload.
	  PlaybackKeyPair Endpoints

       o ImportPlaybackKeyPair	 Imports  the public portion of a new key pair
	 and returns its arn and fingerprint . The privateKey can then be used
	 to  generate  viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to
	 authorized channels.

       o GetPlaybackKeyPair  Gets a specified playback authorization key  pair
	 and  returns  the  arn  and  fingerprint . The privateKey held by the
	 caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to  grant
	 viewers access to authorized channels.

       o ListPlaybackKeyPairs	Gets  summary  information  about playback key
	 pairs.

       o DeletePlaybackKeyPair	Deletes a specified  authorization  key  pair.
	 This  invalidates  future viewer tokens generated using the key pairs
	 privateKey .
	  AWS Tags Endpoints

       o TagResource  Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the spec-
	 ified ARN.

       o UntagResource	Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.

       o ListTagsForResource   Gets  information about AWS tags for the speci-
	 fied ARN.
