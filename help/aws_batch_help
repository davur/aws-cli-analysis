NAME
       batch -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Batch  enables  you  to  run  batch computing workloads on the AWS
       Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists,  and
       engineers  to  access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch
       removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and  managing
       the  required  infrastructure.  AWS  Batch will be familiar to users of
       traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently pro-
       vision  resources  in  response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate
       capacity  constraints,  reduce  compute	costs,	and  deliver   results
       quickly.

       As  a  fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists,
       and engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS  Batch
       automatically  provisions  compute resources and optimizes the workload
       distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS
       Batch,  there is no need to install or manage batch computing software,
       which allows you to focus on analyzing results  and  solving  problems.
       AWS  Batch  reduces  operational  complexities, saves time, and reduces
       costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to
       run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.
