DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your
       log files from Amazon Elastic Compute  Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)  instances,
       Amazon  CloudTrail, or other sources. You can then retrieve the associ-
       ated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the Amazon CloudWatch console,
       the  CloudWatch	Logs commands in the AWS CLI, the CloudWatch Logs API,
       or the CloudWatch Logs SDK.

       You can use CloudWatch Logs to:

       o Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time  :  You  can  use
	 CloudWatch  Logs  to monitor applications and systems using log data.
	 For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that  oc-
	 cur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the
	 rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs  uses
	 your  log  data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required. For
	 example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal  terms
	 (such as "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences
	 of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404"
	 status  codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are search-
	 ing for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a Amazon Cloud-
	 Watch metric that you specify.

       o Monitor  Amazon  CloudTrail  Logged Events : You can create alarms in
	 Amazon CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API	activ-
	 ity  as  captured  by	CloudTrail and use the notification to perform
	 troubleshooting.

       o Archive Log Data : You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
	 in  highly  durable storage. You can change the log retention setting
	 so that any log events older  than  this  setting  are  automatically
	 deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both
	 rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log  ser-
	 vice. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.
