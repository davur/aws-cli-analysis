DESCRIPTION
       This is the AWS Sever Migration Service API Reference . It provides de-
       scriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
       types for the AWS Sever Migration Service (AWS SMS). The topic for each
       action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. You
       can also view the XML request elements in the WSDL.

       Alternatively,  you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's
       tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
       more information, see AWS SDKs .
