DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  ACM Private CA API Reference . It provides descriptions,
       syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data  types  in-
       volved  in  creating  and managing private certificate authorities (CA)
       for your organization.

       The documentation for each action shows the Query API  request  parame-
       ters  and  the  XML response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS
       SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the  programming  language  or
       platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs .

       NOTE:
	  Each	ACM  Private CA API action has a throttling limit which deter-
	  mines the number of times the action can be called per  second.  For
	  more	information,  see API Rate Limits in ACM Private CA in the ACM
	  Private CA user guide.
