DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use the ACM PCA API to create a private certificate authority
       (CA). You must first call the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation. If
       successful,  the  operation  returns  an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for
       your private CA. Use this ARN as input to  the	GetCertificateAuthori-
       tyCsr  operation  to retrieve the certificate signing request (CSR) for
       your private CA certificate. Sign the CSR using the root or an interme-
       diate  CA  in  your on-premises PKI hierarchy, and call the  ImportCer-
       tificateAuthorityCertificate to import your signed private CA  certifi-
       cate into ACM PCA.

       Use your private CA to issue and revoke certificates. These are private
       certificates that identify and secure client computers, servers, appli-
       cations,  services, devices, and users over SSLS/TLS connections within
       your organization. Call the  IssueCertificate operation to issue a cer-
       tificate.  Call	the   RevokeCertificate operation to revoke a certifi-
       cate.

       NOTE:
	  Certificates issued by your private CA can be  trusted  only	within
	  your organization, not publicly.

       Your  private  CA  can  optionally create a certificate revocation list
       (CRL) to track the certificates you revoke. To create a CRL,  you  must
       specify a  RevocationConfiguration object when you call the  CreateCer-
       tificateAuthority operation. ACM PCA writes the CRL  to	an  S3	bucket
       that  you specify. You must specify a bucket policy that grants ACM PCA
       write permission.

       You can also call the  CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport to	create
       an  optional  audit  report that lists every time the CA private key is
       used. The private key is used for signing when the IssueCertificate  or
       RevokeCertificate operation is called.
