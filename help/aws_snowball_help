NAME
       snowball -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses se-
       cure devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises
       data  centers  and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow-
       ball commands described here provide access to the  same  functionality
       that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables
       you to create and manage jobs for Snowball. To  transfer  data  locally
       with  a	Snowball device, you'll need to use the Snowball client or the
       Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the  User
       Guide .
