DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Snow  Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses
       secure  devices	to  transfer  large  amounts  of  data	between   your
       on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
       The Snow commands described here provide access to the same functional-
       ity  that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which
       enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow  device.  To  transfer
       data  locally  with a Snow device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge
       client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or  AWS  OpsHub  for
       Snow Family. For more information, see the User Guide .
