DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Import/Export Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution
       that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of  data  between
       your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
       S3). The Snowball commands described here provide access  to  the  same
       functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console,
       which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball.  To  transfer
       data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll need to use the Snowball
       client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information,
       see the User Guide .
