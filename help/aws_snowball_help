DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses se-
       cure  appliances  to  transfer  large  amounts  of  data  between  your
       on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
       The Snowball commands described here provide access to the  same  func-
       tionality  that	is  available  in the AWS Snowball Management Console,
       which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball.  To  transfer
       data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll need to use the Snowball
       client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information,
       see the User Guide .
