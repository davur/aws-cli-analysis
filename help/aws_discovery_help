NAME
       discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       The AWS Application Discovery Service helps Systems Integrators quickly
       and reliably plan application migration projects by automatically iden-
       tifying applications running in on-premises data centers, their associ-
       ated dependencies, and their performance profile.

       Planning data center migrations can involve thousands of workloads that
       are  often  deeply interdependent. Application discovery and dependency
       mapping are important early first steps in the migration  process,  but
       difficult to perform at scale due to the lack of automated tools.

       The AWS Application Discovery Service automatically collects configura-
       tion and usage data from servers to develop a list of applications, how
       they  perform, and how they are interdependent. This information is se-
       curely retained in an AWS Application Discovery Service database  which
       you  can export as a CSV file into your preferred visualization tool or
       cloud migration solution to help reduce	the  complexity  and  time  in
       planning your cloud migration.

       The  Application  Discovery Service is currently available for preview.
       Only customers who are engaged with AWS Professional Services or a cer-
       tified  AWS  partner  can use the service. To see the list of certified
       partners and request access to the Application Discovery Service,  com-
       plete the following preview form .

       This  API  reference  provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
       for each of the actions and data types for the Discovery  Service.  The
       topic  for  each  action  shows	the API request parameters and the re-
       sponse. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API
       that  is  tailored  to the programming language or platform that you're
       using. For more information, see AWS SDKs .

       This guide is intended for use with the ` AWS  Discovery  Service  User
       Guide
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/what-is-appdiscovery.html`_
       .

       The  following  are short descriptions of each API action, organized by
       function.
	  Managing AWS Agents Using the Application Discovery Service

       An AWS agent is software that you install on  on-premises  servers  and
       virtual	machines that are targeted for discovery and migration. Agents
       run on Linux and Windows Server and collect  server  configuration  and
       activity   information  about  your  applications  and  infrastructure.
       Specifically, agents collect the following information and send	it  to
       the  Application Discovery Service using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) en-
       cryption:

       o User information (user name, home directory)

       o Group information (name)

       o List of installed packages

       o List of kernel modules

       o All create and stop process events

       o DNS queries

       o NIC information

       o TCP/UDP process listening ports

       o TCPV4/V6 connections

       o Operating system information

       o System performance

       o Process performance

       The Application Discovery Service API includes the following actions to
       manage AWS agents:

       o start-data-collection-by-agent-ids  :	Instructs the specified agents
	 to start collecting data. The	Application  Discovery	Service  takes
	 several  minutes  to receive and process data after you initiate data
	 collection.

       o stop-data-collection-by-agent-ids : Instructs the specified agents to
	 stop collecting data.

       o describe-agents  : Lists AWS agents by ID or lists all agents associ-
	 ated with your user account if you did not specify an agent  ID.  The
	 output  includes  agent IDs, IP addresses, media access control (MAC)
	 addresses, agent health, host name where the agent resides,  and  the
	 version number of each agent.
	  Querying Configuration Items

       A  configuration  item  is an IT asset that was discovered in your data
       center by an AWS agent. When you use the Application Discovery Service,
       you  can  specify  filters  and query specific configuration items. The
       service supports Server, Process, and Connection  configuration	items.
       This  means  you  can  specify a value for the following keys and query
       your IT assets:
	  Server

       o server.HostName

       o server.osName

       o server.osVersion

       o server.configurationId

       o server.agentId
	  Process

       o process.name

       o process.CommandLine

       o process.configurationId

       o server.hostName

       o server.osName

       o server.osVersion

       o server.configurationId

       o server.agentId
	  Connection

       o connection.sourceIp

       o connection.sourcePort

       o connection.destinationIp

       o connection.destinationPort

       o sourceProcess.configurationId

       o sourceProcess.commandLine

       o sourceProcess.name

       o destinationProcessId.configurationId

       o destinationProcess.commandLine

       o destinationProcess.name

       o sourceServer.configurationId

       o sourceServer.hostName

       o sourceServer.osName

       o sourceServer.osVersion

       o destinationServer.configurationId

       o destinationServer.hostName

       o destinationServer.osName

       o destinationServer.osVersion

       The Application Discovery Service includes the  following  actions  for
       querying configuration items.

       o describe-configurations  :  Retrieves a list of attributes for a spe-
	 cific configuration ID. For example, the output for a server configu-
	 ration item includes a list of attributes about the server, including
	 host name, operating system, number of network cards, etc.

       o list-configurations : Retrieves a list of configuration items accord-
	 ing  to  the  criteria  you  specify in a filter. The filter criteria
	 identify relationship requirements. For example, you can specify fil-
	 ter criteria of process.name with values of nginx and apache .
	  Tagging Discovered Configuration Items

       You can tag discovered configuration items. Tags are metadata that help
       you categorize IT assets in your data center. Tags  use	a  key	-value
       format. For example, {"key": "serverType", "value": "webServer"} .

       o create-tags : Creates one or more tags for a configuration items.

       o describe-tags	:  Retrieves  a  list  of configuration items that are
	 tagged with a specific tag. Or , retrieves a list  of	all  tags  as-
	 signed to a specific configuration item.

       o delete-tags  :  Deletes  the association between a configuration item
	 and one or more tags.
	  Exporting Data

       You can export data as a CSV file to an Amazon S3 bucket or  into  your
       preferred visualization tool or cloud migration solution to help reduce
       the complexity and time in planning your cloud migration.

       o export-configurations : Exports all discovered configuration data  to
	 an  Amazon  S3  bucket. Data includes tags and tag associations, pro-
	 cesses, connections, servers, and system performance.	This  API  re-
	 turns an export ID which you can query using the GetExportStatus API.

       o describe-export-configurations  : Gets the status of the data export.
	 When the export is complete, the service returns  an  Amazon  S3  URL
	 where you can download CSV files that include the data.
