DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration
       projects by automatically identifying servers, virtual machines	(VMs),
       software,  and  software  dependencies running in your on-premises data
       centers. Application Discovery Service also collects  application  per-
       formance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your migration.
       The data collected by Application Discovery  Service  is  securely  re-
       tained  in an AWS-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can ex-
       port the data as a CSV or XML file into	your  preferred  visualization
       tool  or  cloud-migration solution to plan your migration. For more in-
       formation, see AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ .

       Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:

       o Agentless discovery mode is recommended  for  environments  that  use
	 VMware  vCenter  Server.  This mode doesn't require you to install an
	 agent on each host. Agentless discovery  gathers  server  information
	 regardless  of  the  operating  systems, which minimizes the time re-
	 quired for initial on-premises infrastructure	assessment.  Agentless
	 discovery doesn't collect information about software and software de-
	 pendencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.

       o Agent-based discovery mode collects a richer set of data than	agent-
	 less  discovery  by  using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which
	 you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent  cap-
	 tures infrastructure and application information, including an inven-
	 tory of installed software applications, system and  process  perfor-
	 mance,  resource  utilization, and network dependencies between work-
	 loads. The information collected by agents is secured at rest and  in
	 transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.

       We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environ-
       ments and to collect information about software and software  dependen-
       cies.  You  can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultane-
       ously. Use agentless discovery to quickly complete the  initial	infra-
       structure assessment and then install agents on select hosts.

       Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery so-
       lutions from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners.  Third-party  applica-
       tion  discovery tools can query Application Discovery Service and write
       to the Application Discovery Service database using a public  API.  You
       can  then import the data into either a visualization tool or cloud-mi-
       gration solution.

       WARNING:
	  Application Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive  information.
	  All  data  is  handled according to the AWS Privacy Policy . You can
	  operate Application Discovery Service offline to  inspect  collected
	  data before it is shared with the service.

       Your  AWS  account must be granted access to Application Discovery Ser-
       vice, a process called whitelisting . This is true for AWS partners and
       customers  alike.  To request access, sign up for Application Discovery
       Service .

       This API reference provides descriptions, syntax,  and  usage  examples
       for  each  of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Ser-
       vice. The topic for each action shows the API  request  parameters  and
       the  response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access
       an API that is tailored to the programming language  or	platform  that
       you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs .
