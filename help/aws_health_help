DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS  Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health in-
       formation that is presented in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard .  You
       can get information about events that affect your AWS resources:

       o DescribeEvents : Summary information about events.

       o DescribeEventDetails : Detailed information about one or more events.

       o DescribeAffectedEntities  :  Information about AWS resources that are
	 affected by one or more events.

       In addition, these operations provide information about event types and
       summary counts of events or affected entities:

       o DescribeEventTypes  :	Information about the kinds of events that AWS
	 Health tracks.

       o DescribeEventAggregates : A count of the number of events  that  meet
	 specified criteria.

       o DescribeEntityAggregates : A count of the number of affected entities
	 that meet specified criteria.

       The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from  AWS
       Support	.  Calling the Health API from an account that does not have a
       Business or Enterprise support plan causes a SubscriptionRequiredExcep-
       tion .

       For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4
       Signing Process .

       See the AWS Health User Guide for information about how to use the API.
