DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS  Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health in-
       formation that is presented in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard .  You
       can get information about events that affect your AWS resources:

       o DescribeEvents : Summary information about events.

       o DescribeEventDetails : Detailed information about one or more events.

       o DescribeAffectedEntities  :  Information about AWS resources that are
	 affected by one or more events.

       In addition, these operations provide information about event types and
       summary counts of events or affected entities:

       o DescribeEventTypes  :	Information about the kinds of events that AWS
	 Health tracks.

       o DescribeEventAggregates : A count of the number of events  that  meet
	 specified criteria.

       o DescribeEntityAggregates : A count of the number of affected entities
	 that meet specified criteria.

       AWS Health integrates with AWS Organizations to provide	a  centralized
       view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization.

       o DescribeEventsForOrganization	:  Summary  information  about	events
	 across the organization.

       o DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization : List of  accounts  in  your
	 organization impacted by an event.

       o DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization   :  Detailed  information  about
	 events in your organization.

       o DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization : Information about  AWS  re-
	 sources in your organization that are affected by events.

       You  can  use  the following operations to enable or disable AWS Health
       from working with AWS Organizations.

       o EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization : Enables AWS Health to work
	 with AWS Organizations.

       o DisableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization  : Disables AWS Health from
	 working with AWS Organizations.

       o DescribeHealthServiceStatusForOrganization : Status information about
	 enabling or disabling AWS Health from working with AWS Organizations.

       The  Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS
       Support . Calling the Health API from an account that does not  have  a
       Business or Enterprise support plan causes a SubscriptionRequiredExcep-
       tion .

       For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4
       Signing Process .

       See the AWS Health User Guide for information about how to use the API.
