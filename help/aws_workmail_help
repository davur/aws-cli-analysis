DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  WorkMail  is  a	secure, managed business email and calendaring
       service with support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You
       can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook,
       your browser, or their native iOS and Android email  applications.  You
       can  integrate  Amazon  WorkMail with your existing corporate directory
       and control both the keys that encrypt your data and  the  location  in
       which your data is stored.

       The Amazon WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:

       o Listing and describing organizations

       o Managing users

       o Managing groups

       o Managing resources

       All  Amazon  WorkMail API actions are Amazon-authenticated and certifi-
       cate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also al-
       low for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate ac-
       cess, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role  and  allowing
       an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
       administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkMail  organization
       (or  as	set  in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to,
       the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources.
       This  allows  developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well
       as give users the ability to grant access on a  selective  basis  using
       the IAM model.
