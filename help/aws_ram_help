DESCRIPTION
       This  is the Resource Access Manager API Reference . This documentation
       provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types
       in  RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web
       Services resources across Amazon Web Services accounts and within  your
       organization  or  organizational units (OUs) in Organizations. For sup-
       ported resource types, you can also share resources with IAM roles  and
       IAM  users.  If you have multiple Amazon Web Services accounts, you can
       use RAM to share those resources with other accounts.
