NAME
       cloudwatch -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and
       the applications you run on AWS in real-time. You can use CloudWatch to
       collect	and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure
       for your resources and applications.

       CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make  changes  to
       the  resources  you  are monitoring based on rules that you define. For
       example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk	reads  and  writes  of
       your  Amazon  Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use
       this data to determine whether you should launch  additional  instances
       to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used
       instances to save money.

       In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS,  you
       can  monitor  your  own	custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain sys-
       tem-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance,
       and operational health.
