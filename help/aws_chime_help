DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon  Chime  API (application programming interface) is designed
       for developers to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Ama-
       zon  Chime  accounts,  users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides
       detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including  operations,
       types,  inputs  and  outputs,  and  error  codes. It also includes some
       server-side API actions to use with the Amazon Chime SDK. For more  in-
       formation about the Amazon Chime SDK, see Using the Amazon Chime SDK in
       the Amazon Chime Developer Guide .

       You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface  (AWS  CLI),  or
       the  REST  API  to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the
       AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information  about  using
       it with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
	  Using an AWS SDK

       You  don't  need to write code to calculate a signature for request au-
       thentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by  using  ac-
       cess  keys  that  you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see
       the AWS Developer Center .
	  Using the AWS CLI

       Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls.  For  informa-
       tion  about setting up the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line
       Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . For a list  of
       available  Amazon  Chime commands, see the Amazon Chime commands in the
       AWS CLI Command Reference .
	  Using REST API

       If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate  your  request
       by  providing  a  signature. Amazon Chime supports signature version 4.
       For more information, see Signature Version 4 Signing  Process  in  the
       Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       When  making  REST  API calls, use the service name chime and REST end-
       point https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com .

       Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access
       Management (IAM). For more information, see Identity and Access Manage-
       ment for Amazon Chime in the Amazon Chime Administration Guide .
