DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Outposts  is  a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastruc-
       ture, APIs, and tools to customer premises. By providing  local	access
       to  AWS managed infrastructure, AWS Outposts enables customers to build
       and run applications on premises using the same programming  interfaces
       as  in AWS Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for
       lower latency and local data processing needs.
