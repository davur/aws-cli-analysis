DESCRIPTION
       This is the AWS Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions,
       syntax and usage examples for each of the actions and  data  types  for
       the AWS Proton service.

       The  documentation  for each action shows the Query API request parame-
       ters and the XML response.

       Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to access an API. For  more  in-
       formation, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .

       The  AWS Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Adminis-
       trators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure
       and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications.
       Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to au-
       tomate their application or service deployments.

       Because	administrators	define the infrastructure and tooling that AWS
       Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to  use  all  of  the
       listed API operations.

       When  developers  select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, AWS
       Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their  applications  that
       are  running  on AWS Proton, developers need permissions to the service
       create , list , update and delete API operations and  the  service  in-
       stance list and update API operations.

       To  learn  more about AWS Proton administration, see the AWS Proton Ad-
       ministration Guide .

	  Ensuring Idempotency

       When  you  make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a
       result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete.
       Operations  might also time out or encounter other server issues before
       they're complete, even if the request already returned a  result.  This
       might  make  it	difficult  to determine whether the request succeeded.
       Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to	ensure
       that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original re-
       quest and the subsequent retries are successful, the  operation	occurs
       multiple  times.  This  means that you might create more resources than
       you intended.
	  Idempotency ensures that an API request  action  completes  no  more
	  than	one  time. With an idempotent request, if the original request
	  action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete  suc-
	  cessfully  without  performing any further actions. However, the re-
	  sult might contain updated information, such as the current creation
	  status.

       The  following  lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that en-
       sure idempotency.
	  Idempotent create APIs with a client token

       The API actions in this list support idempotency  with  the  use  of  a
       client  token . The corresponding AWS CLI commands also support idempo-
       tency using a client token. A client token is a unique,	case-sensitive
       string  of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request
       using one of these actions, specify a client token in the  request.  We
       recommend  that you don't reuse the same client token for other API re-
       quests. If you dont provide a client token for these  APIs,  a  default
       client token is automatically provided by SDKs.

       Given a request action that has succeeded:

       If  you	retry the request using the same client token and the same pa-
       rameters, the retry succeeds without  performing  any  further  actions
       other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.

       If  you	retry the request using the same client token, but one or more
       of the parameters are different, the retry throws a ValidationException
       with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error.

       Client  tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry
       the request with the expired token, a new resource is created.

       If the original resource is deleted and you retry the  request,	a  new
       resource is created.

       Idempotent create APIs with a client token:

       o CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion

       o CreateServiceTemplateVersion

       o CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection
	  <p>  <b>Idempotent  delete  APIs</b>	</p> <p>Given a request action
	  that has succeeded:</p> <p>When you retry the request  with  an  API
	  from	this  group  and the resource was deleted, its metadata is re-
	  turned in the response.</p> <p>If you retry and the resource doesn't
	  exist,  the  response is empty.</p> <p>In both cases, the retry suc-
	  ceeds.</p> <p>Idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul>  <li>	<p>DeleteEnvi-
	  ronmentTemplate</p>	</li>	<li>  <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVer-
	  sion</p>  </li>   <li>   <p>DeleteServiceTemplate</p>   </li>   <li>

	  delete  APIs</b>  </p>  <p>Given  a  request	action	that  has suc-
	  ceeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group,
	  if	the    original    request    delete   operation   status   is
	  <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, the retry returns the resource  de-
	  tail	data  in  the  response  without  performing  any  further ac-
	  tions.</p> <p>If the original request delete operation is  complete,
	  a  retry  returns  an empty response.</p> <p>Asynchronous idempotent
	  delete  APIs:</p>  <ul>  <li>  <p>DeleteEnvironment</p>  </li>  <li>
	  <p>DeleteService</p> </li> </ul>
