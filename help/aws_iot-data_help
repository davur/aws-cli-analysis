NAME
       iot-data -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT-Data  enables secure, bi-directional communication between In-
       ternet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded  devices,
       or  smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. It implements a broker for ap-
       plications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish)  and  re-
       trieve,	update,  and delete thing shadows. A thing shadow is a persis-
       tent representation of your things and their state in the AWS cloud.

       NOTE:
	  The default endpoint data.iot.[region].amazonaws.com is intended for
	  testing  purposes  only.  For  production code it is strongly recom-
	  mended to use the custom endpoint for your account  (retrievable via
	  the  iot  describe-endpoint command) to ensure best availability and
	  reachability of the service.

       o delete-thing-shadow

       o get-thing-shadow

       o help
