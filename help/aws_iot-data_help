NAME
       iot-data -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT-Data  enables secure, bi-directional communication between In-
       ternet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded  devices,
       or  smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. It implements a broker for ap-
       plications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish)  and  re-
       trieve,	update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent represen-
       tation of your things and their state in the AWS cloud.

       Find the endpoint address for actions in the AWS IoT data plane by run-
       ning this CLI command:
	  aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS

       The  service  name used by AWS Signature Version 4 to sign requests is:
       iotdevicegateway .

       NOTE:
	  The default endpoint data.iot.[region].amazonaws.com is intended for
	  testing  purposes  only.  For  production code it is strongly recom-
	  mended to use the custom endpoint for your account  (retrievable via
	  the  iot  describe-endpoint command) to ensure best availability and
	  reachability of the service.
