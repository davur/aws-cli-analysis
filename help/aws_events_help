DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  EventBridge  helps  you to respond to state changes in your AWS
       resources. When your resources change state,  they  automatically  send
       events  into  an event stream. You can create rules that match selected
       events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You  can
       also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example,
       you can configure rules to:

       o Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function  to  update  DNS  entries
	 when  an  event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the run-
	 ning state

       o Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon  Kinesis
	 data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availabil-
	 ity risks

       o Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Ama-
	 zon EBS volume

       For  more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the
       Amazon EventBridge User Guide .
