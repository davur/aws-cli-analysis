DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your
       AWS resources. When your resources  change  state,  they  automatically
       send  events  into an event stream. You can create rules that match se-
       lected events in the stream and route them to targets to  take  action.
       You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For
       example, you can configure rules to:

       o Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function  to  update  DNS  entries
	 when  an  event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the run-
	 ning state.

       o Direct specific API records from  CloudTrail  to  an  Amazon  Kinesis
	 stream  for  detailed	analysis of potential security or availability
	 risks.

       o Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Ama-
	 zon EBS volume.

       For  more  information  about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events,
       see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide .
