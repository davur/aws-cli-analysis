DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your
       AWS resources. When your resources change state they automatically send
       events  into  an event stream. You can create rules that match selected
       events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You  can
       also  use  rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For exam-
       ple, you can configure rules to:

       o Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function  to  update  DNS  entries
	 when  an  event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the run-
	 ning state.

       o Direct specific API records from  CloudTrail  to  an  Amazon  Kinesis
	 stream  for  detailed	analysis of potential security or availability
	 risks.

       o Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Ama-
	 zon EBS volume.

       For  more  information about Amazon CloudWatch Events features, see the
       Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide .
