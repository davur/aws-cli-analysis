DESCRIPTION
	  Overview

       This is the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference. This guide provides descrip-
       tions and samples of the DynamoDB API. For information  about  applica-
       tion  development  using  this  API,  see the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
       Guide.

       The following are short descriptions of each API action,  organized  by
       function.

       Managing Tables

       o create-table  -  Creates  a  table  with  user-specified  provisioned
	 throughput settings. You must designate one  attribute  as  the  hash
	 primary  key for the table; you can optionally designate a second at-
	 tribute as the range primary key. DynamoDB creates indexes  on  these
	 key  attributes  for fast data access. Optionally, you can create one
	 or more secondary indexes,  which  provide  fast  data  access  using
	 non-key attributes.

       o describe-table  -  Returns  metadata for a table, such as table size,
	 status, and index information.

       o update-table - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for a ta-
	 ble.  Optionally,  you can modify the provisioned throughput settings
	 for global secondary indexes on the table.

       o list-tables - Returns a list of all tables associated with  the  cur-
	 rent AWS account and endpoint.

       o delete-table - Deletes a table and all of its indexes.

       Reading Data

       o get-item  - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a given
	 primary key. By default, get-item performs an	eventually  consistent
	 read;	however,  applications	can specify a strongly consistent read
	 instead.

       o batch-get-item - Performs multiple get-item requests for  data  items
	 using	their primary keys, from one table or multiple tables. The re-
	 sponse from batch-get-item has a size limit of 1  MB  and  returns  a
	 maximum of 100 items. Both eventually consistent and strongly consis-
	 tent reads can be used.

       o query - Returns one or more items from a table or a secondary	index.
	 You  must provide a specific hash key value. You can narrow the scope
	 of the query using comparison operators against a range key value, or
	 on  the  index  key. query supports either eventual or strong consis-
	 tency. A single response has a size limit of 1 MB.

       o scan - Reads every item in a table; the result set is eventually con-
	 sistent.  You can limit the number of items returned by filtering the
	 data attributes, using conditional expressions. scan can be  used  to
	 enable  ad-hoc  querying  of a table against non-key attributes; how-
	 ever, since this is a full table scan without using  an  index,  scan
	 should  not  be used for any application query use case that requires
	 predictable performance.

       Modifying Data

       o put-item - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing  item  with  a
	 new  item  (including	all the attributes). By default, if an item in
	 the table already exists with the same primary key, the new item com-
	 pletely replaces the existing item. You can use conditional operators
	 to replace an item only if its attribute values match certain	condi-
	 tions,  or to insert a new item only if that item doesn't already ex-
	 ist.

       o update-item - Modifies the attributes of an existing  item.  You  can
	 also  use  conditional  operators  to	perform  an update only if the
	 item's attribute values match certain conditions.

       o delete-item - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. You can  use
	 conditional  operators to perform a delete an item only if the item's
	 attribute values match certain conditions.

       o batch-write-item - Performs multiple  put-item  and  delete-item  re-
	 quests  across  multiple tables in a single request. A failure of any
	 request(s) in the batch will not cause  the  entire  batch-write-item
	 operation  to	fail.  Supports  batches  of  up to 25 items to put or
	 delete, with a maximum total request size of 1 MB.
