DESCRIPTION
       Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides
       fast and predictable performance with  seamless	scalability.  DynamoDB
       lets  you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a
       distributed database, so that you don't have to	worry  about  hardware
       provisioning,  setup and configuration, replication, software patching,
       or cluster scaling.

       With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can  store  and  re-
       trieve  any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You
       can scale up or scale down your	tables'  throughput  capacity  without
       downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console
       to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.

       DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and  traffic  for  your	tables
       over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and stor-
       age requirements, while maintaining consistent  and  fast  performance.
       All  of	your  data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automati-
       cally replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an  AWS  region,
       providing built-in high availability and data durability.
