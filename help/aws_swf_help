DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon  Simple Workflow Service API Reference is intended for pro-
       grammers who need detailed information about the Amazon SWF actions and
       data types.

       For  an broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, please go
       to the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       This section provides an overview of Amazon SWF actions.

       Action Categories

       The Amazon SWF actions can be grouped into the  following  major  cate-
       gories.

       o Actions related to Activities

       o Actions related to Deciders

       o Actions related to Workflow Executions

       o Actions related to Administration

       o Actions related to Visibility

       Actions related to Activities

       The following are actions that are performed by activity workers:

       o poll-for-activity-task

       o respond-activity-task-completed

       o respond-activity-task-failed

       o respond-activity-task-canceled

       o record-activity-task-heartbeat

       Activity  workers  use  the  poll-for-activity-task to get new activity
       tasks. After a worker receives an activity task	from  Amazon  SWF,  it
       performs the task and responds using respond-activity-task-completed if
       successful or respond-activity-task-failed if unsuccessful.

       Actions related to Deciders

       The following are actions that are performed by deciders:

       o poll-for-decision-task

       o respond-decision-task-completed

       Deciders use poll-for-decision-task to get decision tasks. After a  de-
       cider  receives	a decision task from Amazon SWF, it examines its work-
       flow  execution	history  and  decides  what  to  do  next.  It	 calls
       respond-decision-task-completed	to complete the decision task and pro-
       vide zero or more next decisions.

       Actions related to Workflow Executions

       The following actions operate on a workflow execution:

       o request-cancel-workflow-execution

       o start-workflow-execution

       o signal-workflow-execution

       o terminate-workflow-execution

       Actions related to Administration

       Although you can perform administrative tasks from the Amazon SWF  con-
       sole,  you can use the actions in this section to automate functions or
       build your own administrative tools.

       Activity Management

       o register-activity-type

       o deprecate-activity-type

       Workflow Management

       o register-workflow-type

       o deprecate-workflow-type

       Domain Management

       o register-domain

       o deprecate-domain

       Workflow Execution Management

       o request-cancel-workflow-execution

       o terminate-workflow-execution

       Visibility Actions

       Although you can perform visibility actions from the  Amazon  SWF  con-
       sole, you can use the actions in this section to build your own console
       or administrative tools.
