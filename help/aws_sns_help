DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Simple  Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that
       enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications
       can  use  Amazon  SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to
       interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For  more  in-
       formation  about  this  product see http://aws.amazon.com/sns . For de-
       tailed information about Amazon SNS features and their  associated  API
       calls, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .

       We  also  provide  SDKs	that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your
       preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that au-
       tomatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your
       service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses.  For
       a list of available SDKs, go to Tools for Amazon Web Services .
