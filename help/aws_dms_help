DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Database  Migration Service (AWS DMS) can migrate your data to and
       from the most widely used commercial and open-source databases such  as
       Oracle,	PostgreSQL,  Microsoft	SQL  Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB,
       Amazon Aurora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive  Server  Enterprise  (ASE).  The
       service	supports  homogeneous  migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as
       well as heterogeneous migrations between different database  platforms,
       such as Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL.
