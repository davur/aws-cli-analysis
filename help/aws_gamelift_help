DESCRIPTION
       Welcome	to  the  Amazon  GameLift API Reference . Amazon GameLift is a
       managed Amazon Web Services (AWS) service for  developers  who  need  a
       scalable,  server-based solution for multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift
       provides setup and deployment of game servers, and handles  infrastruc-
       ture scaling and session management.

       This  reference	describes  the low-level service API for GameLift. You
       can call this API directly or use the AWS SDK for your  preferred  lan-
       guage. The AWS SDK includes a set of high-level GameLift actions multi-
       player game sessions. Alternatively, you can use the  AWS  command-line
       interface  (CLI) tool, which includes commands for GameLift. For admin-
       istrative actions, you can also use the Amazon GameLift console.

       Set Up and Manage Game Servers

       Use  these  administrative  actions  to configure GameLift to host your
       game servers. When setting up GameLift, you'll need to (1) configure  a
       build  for your game and upload build files, and (2) set up one or more
       fleets to host game sessions.  Once  you've  created  and  activated  a
       fleet,  you can assign aliases to it, scale capacity, track performance
       and utilization, etc.
