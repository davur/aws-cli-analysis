DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GameLift  is  a managed service for developers who need a scal-
       able, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Use Amazon
       GameLift  for  these  tasks:  (1) set up computing resources and deploy
       your game servers, (2) run game sessions and get  players  into	games,
       (3) automatically scale your resources to meet player demand and manage
       costs, and (4) track in-depth metrics on game  server  performance  and
       player usage.

       The Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:

       o Manage  game  sessions  and  player access -- Retrieve information on
	 available game sessions; create new game sessions;  send  player  re-
	 quests to join a game session.

       o Configure  and manage game server resources -- Manage builds, fleets,
	 queues, and aliases; set auto-scaling	policies;  retrieve  logs  and
	 metrics.

       This  reference	guide  describes  the low-level service API for Amazon
       GameLift. You can use the API functionality with these tools:

       o The Amazon Web Services software development kit (AWS SDK ) is avail-
	 able  in  multiple languages including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to ac-
	 cess the API programmatically from an application,  such  as  a  game
	 client.

       o The  AWS  command-line  interface  (CLI) tool is primarily useful for
	 handling administrative actions, such as setting up and managing Ama-
	 zon  GameLift settings and resources. You can use the AWS CLI to man-
	 age all of your AWS services.

       o The AWS Management Console for Amazon GameLift provides a web	inter-
	 face  to manage your Amazon GameLift settings and resources. The con-
	 sole includes a  dashboard  for  tracking  key  resources,  including
	 builds  and  fleets,  and  displays usage and performance metrics for
	 your games as customizable graphs.

       o Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your  game's  integration
	 with  Amazon  GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools
	 supports a subset of key API actions, which can be called from either
	 the AWS CLI or programmatically. See Testing an Integration .
