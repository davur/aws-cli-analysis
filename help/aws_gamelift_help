DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GameLift  is  a managed service for developers who need a scal-
       able, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Use Amazon
       GameLift  for  these  tasks:  (1) set up computing resources and deploy
       your game servers, (2) run game sessions and get  players  into	games,
       (3) automatically scale your resources to meet player demand and manage
       costs, and (4) track in-depth metrics on game  server  performance  and
       player usage.

       When  setting  up  hosting  resources,  you can deploy your custom game
       server or use the Amazon GameLift Realtime  Servers.  Realtime  Servers
       gives  you  the ability to quickly stand up lightweight, efficient game
       servers with the core Amazon GameLift infrastructure already built in.
