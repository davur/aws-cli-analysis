DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need de-
       tailed information about the AWS Support actions and data  types.  This
       service	enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically.
       It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.

       The AWS Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor features.
       You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check re-
       sults, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.

       The following list describes the AWS Support case management actions:

       o Service names, issue categories, and available severity  levels.  The
	 actions   describe-services  and  describe-severity-levels enable you
	 to obtain AWS service names, service codes, service  categories,  and
	 problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the  cre-
	 ate-case action.

       o Case creation, case details, and case resolution. The	actions   cre-
	 ate-case  ,   describe-cases , and  resolve-case enable you to create
	 AWS Support cases, retrieve them, and resolve them.

       o Case  communication.	The   actions	 describe-communications   and
	 add-communication-to-case  enable  you to retrieve and add communica-
	 tion to AWS Support cases.

       The following list describes the actions available from the AWS Support
       service for Trusted Advisor:

       o describe-trusted-advisor-checks  returns  the list of checks that run
	 against your AWS resources.

       o Using the CheckId for a specific check returned by DescribeTrustedAd-
	 visorChecks,  you  can call  describe-trusted-advisor-check-result to
	 obtain the results for the check you specified.

       o describe-trusted-advisor-check-summaries returns  summarized  results
	 for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.

       o refresh-trusted-advisor-check	requests  that Trusted Advisor rerun a
	 specified check.

       o describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses reports  the  refresh
	 status of one or more checks.

       For  authentication  of	requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4
       Signing Process .

       See the AWS Support User Guide for information about how  to  use  this
       service	to  create  and  manage  your  support	cases, and how to call
       Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
