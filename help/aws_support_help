DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need de-
       tailed information about the AWS Support  operations  and  data	types.
       This  service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmati-
       cally. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.

       The AWS Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor features.
       You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check re-
       sults, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.

       The following list describes the AWS  Support  case  management	opera-
       tions:

       o Service  names,  issue categories, and available severity levels. The
	 describe-services and	describe-severity-levels operations return AWS
	 service  names, service codes, service categories, and problem sever-
	 ity levels. You use these values when you call the  create-case oper-
	 ation.

       o Case  creation, case details, and case resolution. The  create-case ,
	 describe-cases ,  describe-attachment , and  resolve-case  operations
	 create  AWS  Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and re-
	 solve cases.

       o Case communication. The   describe-communications  ,	add-communica-
	 tion-to-case  ,  and	add-attachments-to-set operations retrieve and
	 add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.

       The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Sup-
       port service for Trusted Advisor:

       o describe-trusted-advisor-checks  returns  the list of checks that run
	 against your AWS resources.

       o Using	the  checkId  for  a   specific   check   returned   by    de-
	 scribe-trusted-advisor-checks	, you can call	describe-trusted-advi-
	 sor-check-result to obtain the results for the check you specified.

       o describe-trusted-advisor-check-summaries returns  summarized  results
	 for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.

       o refresh-trusted-advisor-check	requests  that Trusted Advisor rerun a
	 specified check.

       o describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses reports  the  refresh
	 status of one or more checks.

       For  authentication  of	requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4
       Signing Process .

       See About the AWS Support API in the AWS Support User Guide for	infor-
       mation  about how to use this service to create and manage your support
       cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of  checks  on  your
       resources.
