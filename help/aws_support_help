       support -

DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS Support API Reference is intended for programmers who need de-
       tailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. You
       can  use the API to manage your support cases programmatically. The AWS
       Support API uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.

       NOTE:

	  o You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS
	    Support API.

	  o If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have
	    a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredEx-
	    ception error message appears. For information about changing your
	    support plan, see AWS Support .

       The AWS Support service also exposes a set of AWS Trusted Advisor  fea-
       tures.  You  can  retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get
       check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
       checks.

       The  following  list  describes	the AWS Support case management opera-
       tions:

       o Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels -  The
	 DescribeServices  and	 DescribeSeverityLevels  operations return AWS
	 service names, service codes, service categories, and problem	sever-
	 ity levels. You use these values when you call the  CreateCase opera-
	 tion.

       o Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The  CreateCase  ,
	 DescribeCases	,   DescribeAttachment	,  and	ResolveCase operations
	 create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases,  and  re-
	 solve cases.

       o Case communication - The  DescribeCommunications ,  AddCommunication-
	 ToCase , and  AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add	commu-
	 nications and attachments to AWS Support cases.

       The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Sup-
       port service for Trusted Advisor:

       o DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the  list  of  checks  that  run
	 against your AWS resources.

       o Using	the  checkId  for  a  specific	check  returned  by  Describe-
	 TrustedAdvisorChecks , you can  call	DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRe-
	 sult to obtain the results for the check that you specified.

       o DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries  returns	summarized results for
	 one or more Trusted Advisor checks.

       o RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests  that  Trusted  Advisor  rerun  a
	 specified check.

       o DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status
	 of one or more checks.

       For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses  Signature  Version  4
       Signing Process .

       See  About the AWS Support API in the AWS Support User Guide for infor-
       mation about how to use this service to create and manage your  support
       cases,  and  how  to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your
       resources.
