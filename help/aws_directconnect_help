NAME
       directconnect -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect
       location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit  Ethernet  fiber-optic
       cable.  One  end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to
       an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in  place,  you  can
       create  virtual	interfaces  directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)  and  Amazon  Simple  Storage
       Service	(Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC),
       bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An  AWS  Di-
       rect  Connect location provides access to AWS in the region it is asso-
       ciated with, as well as access to other US regions.  For  example,  you
       can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in
       the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US  Regions  and
       AWS GovCloud (US).
