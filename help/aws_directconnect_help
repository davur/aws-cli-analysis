DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network con-
       nection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS  Di-
       rect  Connect,  you  can establish private connectivity between AWS and
       your data center, office, or  colocation  environment,  which  in  many
       cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and
       provide a more consistent network experience than  Internet-based  con-
       nections.
