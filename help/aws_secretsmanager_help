DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage,
       and retrieve, secrets.

       This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API.  For  more
       information  about using this service, see the AWS Secrets Manager User
       Guide .
	  API Version

       This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets
       Manager API version 2017-10-17.

       NOTE:
	  As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,
	  which consist of libraries and sample code for  various  programming
	  languages  and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android.
	  The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic  access  to
	  AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically
	  signing requests, managing errors, and retrying  requests  automati-
	  cally.  For more information about the AWS SDKs, including download-
	  ing and installing them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services .

       We recommend you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Se-
       crets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query
       API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service.  To  learn
       more  about  the  Secrets  Manager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Re-
       quests in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide .

       Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and
       doesn't	require  you  to use GET for some actions and POST for others.
       However, GET requests are subject to the  limitation  size  of  a  URL.
       Therefore,  for	operations  that  require larger sizes, use a POST re-
       quest.
	  Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager

       We    welcome	your	feedback.    Send     your     comments     to
       awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com , or post your feedback and ques-
       tions in the AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum . For	more  informa-
       tion about the AWS Discussion Forums, see Forums Help .
	  How examples are presented

       The  JSON  that	AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters
       and the service returns as a response to HTTP  query  requests  contain
       single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The
       JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with  both  line
       breaks  and  white space to improve readability. When example input pa-
       rameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the  screen,  you
       can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit
       the input as a single JSON text string.
	  Logging API Requests

       AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS
       API  calls  for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
       bucket. By using information that's collected by  AWS  CloudTrail,  you
       can  determine  the  requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who
       made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about  AWS  Se-
       crets  Manager  and support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Secrets
       Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail in  the  AWS	Secrets  Manager  User
       Guide  . To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find
       your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide .
