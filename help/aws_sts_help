DESCRIPTION
       The  AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you
       to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials  for  AWS  Identity
       and  Access  Management	(IAM) users or for users that you authenticate
       (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For
       more  detailed information about using this service, go to Using Tempo-
       rary Security Credentials .

       For information about setting up signatures and	authorization  through
       the  API, go to Signing AWS API Requests in the AWS General Reference .
       For general information about the Query API, go	to  Making  Query  Re-
       quests  in Using IAM . For information about using security tokens with
       other AWS products, go to Using Temporary Security Credentials  to  Ac-
       cess AWS in Using Temporary Security Credentials .

       If  you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a
       specific AWS product, you can find the product's  technical  documenta-
       tion at http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ .
	  Endpoints

       For  information  about STS endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the
       AWS General Reference .
	  Recording API requests

       STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS  calls
       for  your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By
       using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine  what  re-
       quests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was
       made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to  turn
       it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide .
