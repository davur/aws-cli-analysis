DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Simple  Queue  Service  (Amazon	SQS) offers a reliable, highly
       scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between com-
       puters.	By  using  Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between
       distributed components of their	applications  that  perform  different
       tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always
       available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to  build  an  automated  workflow,
       working	in  close  conjunction	with  the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
       (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.

       Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale	messaging  infrastruc-
       ture  as  a  web  service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read
       messages without any installed software or special firewall  configura-
       tions.  Components  of  applications  using Amazon SQS can run indepen-
       dently, and do not need to be on the same network, developed  with  the
       same technologies, or running at the same time.
