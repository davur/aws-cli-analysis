DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference . This section
       describes who should read this guide, how the guide is  organized,  and
       other  resources  related  to  the  Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon
       SQS).

       Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing  mes-
       sages  as  they	travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you can
       move data between distributed components of your applications that per-
       form  different	tasks without losing messages or requiring each compo-
       nent to be always available.
