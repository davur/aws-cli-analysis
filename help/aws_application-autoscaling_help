	  API Summary

       The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of ac-
       tions:

       o Register and manage scalable targets - Register  AWS  or  custom  re-
	 sources as scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling
	 can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve in-
	 formation on existing scalable targets.

       o Configure  and  manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to
	 dynamically scale your resources in response  to  CloudWatch  alarms,
	 schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your re-
	 cent scaling activity history.

       o Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume au-
	 tomatic scaling by calling the  RegisterScalableTarget action for any
	 Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume,
	 individually  or  in combination, scale-out activities triggered by a
	 scaling policy, scale-in activities triggered by  a  scaling  policy,
	 and scheduled scaling.

       To  learn  more	about  Application Auto Scaling, including information
       about granting IAM users  required  permissions	for  Application  Auto
       Scaling actions, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide .
