NAME
       appconfigdata -

DESCRIPTION
       AppConfig  Data	provides  the data plane APIs your application uses to
       retrieve configuration data. Here's how it works:

       Your application retrieves configuration data by first  establishing  a
       configuration  session using the AppConfig Data	StartConfigurationSes-
       sion API action. Your session's client then  makes  periodic  calls  to
       GetLatestConfiguration to check for and retrieve the latest data avail-
       able.

       When calling StartConfigurationSession , your code sends the  following
       information:

       o Identifiers  (ID  or  name) of an AppConfig application, environment,
	 and configuration profile that the session tracks.

       o (Optional) The minimum amount of time the session's client must  wait
	 between calls to GetLatestConfiguration .

       In  response,  AppConfig  provides  an  InitialConfigurationToken to be
       given to the session's client and used the first time it calls  GetLat-
       estConfiguration for that session.

       When  calling  GetLatestConfiguration , your client code sends the most
       recent ConfigurationToken value it has and receives in response:

       o NextPollConfigurationToken : the ConfigurationToken value to  use  on
	 the next call to GetLatestConfiguration .

       o NextPollIntervalInSeconds  :  the  duration  the  client  should wait
	 before making its next call to GetLatestConfiguration . This duration
	 may vary over the course of the session, so it should be used instead
	 of the value sent on the StartConfigurationSession call.

       o The configuration: the latest data intended for the session. This may
	 be empty if the client already has the latest version of the configu-
	 ration.

       For more information and to view example CLI commands that show how  to
       retrieve  a configuration using the AppConfig Data StartConfigurationS-
       ession and GetLatestConfiguration API actions, see Receiving  the  con-
       figuration in the AppConfig User Guide .
