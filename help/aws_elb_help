DESCRIPTION
       Elastic	Load Balancing is a cost-effective and easy to use web service
       to help you improve the availability and scalability of	your  applica-
       tion  running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2). It makes it
       easy for you to distribute application loads between two  or  more  EC2
       instances.  Elastic  Load  Balancing  supports the growth in traffic of
       your application by enabling availability through redundancy.

       This guide provides detailed information about Elastic  Load  Balancing
       actions,  data  types,  and  parameters	that can be used for sending a
       query request. Query requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that  use  the
       HTTP  verb GET or POST and a query parameter named Action or Operation.
       Action is used throughout this  documentation,  although  Operation  is
       supported for backward compatibility with other AWS Query APIs.

       For  detailed information on constructing a query request using the ac-
       tions, data types, and parameters mentioned in this guide, go to  Using
       the Query API in the Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide .

       For  detailed  information  about  Elastic  Load Balancing features and
       their associated actions, go to Using Elastic  Load  Balancing  in  the
       Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide .

       This  reference	guide is based on the current WSDL, which is available
       at:
       http://elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com/doc/2012-06-01/ElasticLoadBalancing.wsdl

       Endpoints

       The examples in this guide assume that your load balancers are  created
       in the US East (Northern Virginia) region and use us-east-1 as the end-
       point.

       You can create your load balancers in other AWS regions.  For  informa-
       tion  about  regions and endpoints supported by Elastic Load Balancing,
       see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
