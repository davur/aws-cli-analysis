DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use  the  Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) direct APIs to di-
       rectly read the data on your EBS snapshots, and identify the difference
       between	two  snapshots.  You  can view the details of blocks in an EBS
       snapshot, compare the block difference between two snapshots,  and  di-
       rectly  access the data in a snapshot. If youre an independent software
       vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for EBS, the  EBS  direct  APIs
       make  it easier and more cost-effective to track incremental changes on
       your EBS volumes via EBS snapshots. This can be done without having  to
       create new volumes from EBS snapshots.

       This  API  reference  provides  detailed information about the actions,
       data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more in-
       formation  about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and ex-
       amples of how to use them effectively, see Accessing the Contents of an
       EBS  Snapshot in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide . For more
       information about the supported AWS  Regions,  endpoints,  and  service
       quotas  for  the  EBS  direct APIs, see Amazon Elastic Block Store End-
       points and Quotas in the AWS General Reference .
