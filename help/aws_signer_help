DESCRIPTION
       With  code  signing  for IoT, you can sign code that you create for any
       IoT device that is supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Code signing
       is  available  through  Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management ,
       and integrated with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) . In  order  to  sign
       code,  you  import a third-party code signing certificate with ACM that
       is used to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT  Device  Manage-
       ment.  For  general  information about using code signing, see the Code
       Signing for IoT Developer Guide .
