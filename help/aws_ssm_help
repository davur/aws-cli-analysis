DESCRIPTION
       Simple Systems Manager (SSM) enables you to remotely manage the config-
       uration of your Amazon EC2 instance. Using SSM, you can run scripts  or
       commands  using	either	EC2  Run Command or SSM Config. (SSM Config is
       currently available only for Windows instances.)
	  Run Command

       Run Command provides an on-demand experience  for  executing  commands.
       You  can  use  pre-defined  Amazon SSM documents to perform the actions
       listed later in this section, or you can  create  your  own  documents.
       With  these  documents,	you  can  remotely configure your instances by
       sending commands using the Commands page in the Amazon  EC2  console  ,
       AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell , or the AWS CLI .

       Run  Command  reports  the status of the command execution for each in-
       stance targeted by a command. You can also audit the command  execution
       to  understand who executed commands, when, and what changes were made.
       By switching between different SSM documents, you can quickly configure
       your  instances	with  different types of commands. To get started with
       Run Command, verify that your environment meets the  prerequisites  for
       remotely running commands on EC2 instances (Linux or Windows ).
	  SSM Config

       SSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. SSM Config
       is currently only available for Windows instances. With SSM Config, you
       can  specify  a	setup  configuration for your instances. SSM Config is
       similar to EC2 User Data, which is  another  way  of  running  one-time
       scripts	or  applying settings during instance launch. SSM Config is an
       extension of this capability. Using  SSM  documents,  you  can  specify
       which  actions  the  system should perform on your instances, including
       which applications to install, which AWS Directory Service directory to
       join,  which  Microsoft	PowerShell  modules to install, etc. If an in-
       stance is missing one or more of these configurations, the system makes
       those  changes. By default, the system checks every five minutes to see
       if there is a new configuration to apply as defined in a new SSM  docu-
       ment. If so, the system updates the instances accordingly. In this way,
       you can remotely maintain a consistent configuration baseline  on  your
       instances.  SSM	Config is available using the AWS CLI or the AWS Tools
       for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see Managing Windows  In-
       stance Configuration .

       SSM Config and Run Command include the following pre-defined documents.

       WARNING:
	  The commands or scripts specified in SSM documents run with adminis-
	  trative privilege on your instances because  the  Amazon  SSM  agent
	  runs	as  root  on Linux and the EC2Config service runs in the Local
	  System account on Windows. If a user has permission to  execute  any
	  of  the  pre-defined	SSM  documents	(any document that begins with
	  AWS-) then that user also has administrator access to the  instance.
	  Delegate access to SSM and Run Command judiciously. This becomes ex-
	  tremely important if you create your own SSM documents.  Amazon  Web
	  Services  does  not  provide guidance about how to create secure SSM
	  documents. You create SSM documents and delegate access to Run  Com-
	  mand	at  your  own  risk. As a security best practice, we recommend
	  that you assign access to "AWS-" documents, especially the  AWS-Run-
	  ShellScript  document on Linux and the AWS-RunPowerShellScript docu-
	  ment on Windows, to trusted administrators only. You can create  SSM
	  documents  for specific tasks and delegate access to non-administra-
	  tors.
