DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) enables you to remotely manage
       the configuration of your Amazon EC2 instances, virtual machines (VMs),
       or  servers  in	your on-premises environment or in an environment pro-
       vided by other cloud providers using scripts, commands, or  the	Amazon
       EC2  console.  SSM includes an on-demand solution called Amazon EC2 Run
       Command and a lightweight instance configuration  solution  called  SSM
       Config .

       This  references  is  intended to be used with the EC2 Run Command User
       Guide for Linux or Windows .

       NOTE:
	      You must register your on-premises servers and  VMs  through  an
	      activation  process before you can configure them using Run Com-
	      mand. Registered servers and VMs are called managed instances  .
	      For  more information, see Setting Up Run Command On Managed In-
	      stances (On-Premises Servers and VMs) on Linux or Setting Up Run
	      Command  On  Managed  Instances (On-Premises Servers and VMs) on
	      Windows .

	  Run Command

       Run Command provides an on-demand experience  for  executing  commands.
       You  can  use  pre-defined  SSM documents to perform the actions listed
       later in this section, or you can create your own documents. With these
       documents,  you	can  remotely configure your instances by sending com-
       mands using the Commands page in the Amazon EC2 console , AWS Tools for
       Windows PowerShell , the AWS CLI , or AWS SDKs.

       Run  Command  reports  the status of the command execution for each in-
       stance targeted by a command. You can also audit the command  execution
       to  understand who executed commands, when, and what changes were made.
       By switching between different SSM documents, you can quickly configure
       your  instances	with  different types of commands. To get started with
       Run Command, verify that your environment meets the  prerequisites  for
       remotely running commands on EC2 instances (Linux or Windows ).
	  SSM Config

       SSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. SSM Config
       is currently only available for Windows instances. With SSM Config, you
       can  specify  a	setup  configuration for your instances. SSM Config is
       similar to EC2 User Data, which is  another  way  of  running  one-time
       scripts	or  applying settings during instance launch. SSM Config is an
       extension of this capability. Using  SSM  documents,  you  can  specify
       which  actions  the  system should perform on your instances, including
       which applications to install, which AWS Directory Service directory to
       join,  which  Microsoft	PowerShell  modules to install, etc. If an in-
       stance is missing one or more of these configurations, the system makes
       those  changes. By default, the system checks every five minutes to see
       if there is a new configuration to apply as defined in a new SSM  docu-
       ment. If so, the system updates the instances accordingly. In this way,
       you can remotely maintain a consistent configuration baseline  on  your
       instances.  SSM	Config is available using the AWS CLI or the AWS Tools
       for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see Managing Windows  In-
       stance Configuration .

       SSM Config and Run Command include the following pre-defined documents.
	  Linux

       o AWS-RunShellScript to run shell scripts

       o AWS-UpdateSSMAgent to update the Amazon SSM agent
	  Windows

       o AWS-JoinDirectoryServiceDomain to join an AWS Directory

       o AWS-RunPowerShellScript to run PowerShell commands or scripts

       o AWS-UpdateEC2Config to update the EC2Config service

       o AWS-ConfigureWindowsUpdate to configure Windows Update settings

       o AWS-InstallApplication  to install, repair, or uninstall software us-
	 ing an MSI package

       o AWS-InstallPowerShellModule to install PowerShell modules

       o AWS-ConfigureCloudWatch to configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs to  moni-
	 tor applications and systems

       o AWS-ListWindowsInventory to collect information about an EC2 instance
	 running in Windows.

       o AWS-FindWindowsUpdates to scan an instance and determines  which  up-
	 dates are missing.

       o AWS-InstallMissingWindowsUpdates  to  install missing updates on your
	 EC2 instance.

       o AWS-InstallSpecificWindowsUpdates to install one or more specific up-
	 dates.

       WARNING:
	  The commands or scripts specified in SSM documents run with adminis-
	  trative privilege on your instances because  the  Amazon  SSM  agent
	  runs	as  root  on Linux and the EC2Config service runs in the Local
	  System account on Windows. If a user has permission to  execute  any
	  of  the  pre-defined	SSM  documents	(any document that begins with
	  AWS-) then that user also has administrator access to the  instance.
	  Delegate  access to Run Command and SSM Config judiciously. This be-
	  comes extremely important if you create your own SSM documents. Ama-
	  zon  Web  Services does not provide guidance about how to create se-
	  cure SSM documents. You create SSM documents and delegate access  to
	  Run Command at your own risk. As a security best practice, we recom-
	  mend that you assign access  to  "AWS-"  documents,  especially  the
	  AWS-RunShellScript document on Linux and the AWS-RunPowerShellScript
	  document on Windows, to trusted administrators only. You can	create
	  SSM documents for specific tasks and delegate access to non-adminis-
	  trators.

       lowing topics in the SSM User Guide:
