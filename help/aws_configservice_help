DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Config  provides  a way to keep track of the configurations of all
       the AWS resources associated with your AWS account.  You  can  use  AWS
       Config to get the current and historical configurations of each AWS re-
       source and also to get information about the relationship  between  the
       resources.  An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
       instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an Elastic  network  In-
       terface	(ENI),	or  a security group. For a complete list of resources
       currently supported by AWS Config, see Supported AWS Resources .

       You can access and manage AWS Config through the  AWS  Management  Con-
       sole,  the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config API, or
       the AWS SDKs for AWS Config

       This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API  and
       the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config.

       The  AWS  Config  API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing
       requests. For more information about how to sign a  request  with  this
       protocol, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

       For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated
       actions or commands, as well as how to work with  AWS  Management  Con-
       sole, see What Is AWS Config? in the AWS Config Developer Guide .
