DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capa-
       bility for validating IoT devices during device	software  development.
       Device  Advisor	provides  pre-built tests that you can use to validate
       IoT devices for reliable and secure  connectivity  with	AWS  IoT  Core
       before  deploying  devices  to production. By using Device Advisor, you
       can confirm that your devices can connect to AWS IoT Core, follow secu-
       rity  best  practices and, if applicable, receive software updates from
       IoT Device Management.  You  can  also  download  signed  qualification
       reports	to submit to the AWS Partner Network to get your device quali-
       fied for the AWS Partner Device Catalog without the need to  send  your
       device in and wait for it to be tested.
