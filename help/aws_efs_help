DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file
       storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon
       EFS,  storage  capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically
       as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they
       need, when they need it. For more information, see the User Guide .
